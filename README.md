## üõ† Code Example

### Visual Basic Code
```vb
Public Class Calculator

    Private firstNumber As Double
    Private secondNumber As Double
    Private operation As String

    ' Handle number button clicks
    Private Sub Button_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btn0.Click, btn1.Click, btn2.Click, btn3.Click, btn4.Click, btn5.Click, btn6.Click, btn7.Click, btn8.Click, btn9.Click
        txtDisplay.Text &= CType(sender, Button).Text
    End Sub

    ' Handle operator button clicks
    Private Sub Operator_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnAdd.Click, btnSubtract.Click, btnMultiply.Click, btnDivide.Click
        firstNumber = Double.Parse(txtDisplay.Text)
        operation = CType(sender, Button).Text
        txtDisplay.Clear()
    End Sub

    ' Perform calculation
    Private Sub btnEquals_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnEquals.Click
        Try
            secondNumber = Double.Parse(txtDisplay.Text)
            Select Case operation
                Case "+"
                    txtDisplay.Text = (firstNumber + secondNumber).ToString()
                Case "-"
                    txtDisplay.Text = (firstNumber - secondNumber).ToString()
                Case "*"
                    txtDisplay.Text = (firstNumber * secondNumber).ToString()
                Case "/"
                    If secondNumber <> 0 Then
                        txtDisplay.Text = (firstNumber / secondNumber).ToString()
                    Else
                        txtDisplay.Text = "Error: Division by zero"
                    End If
            End Select
        Catch ex As Exception
            txtDisplay.Text = "Error: Invalid input"
        End Try
    End Sub

    ' Clear the display
    Private Sub btnClear_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnClear.Click
        txtDisplay.Clear()
        firstNumber = 0
        secondNumber = 0
    End Sub

End Class
```
